# Meeting 4 Date(March 8th 2024)
Member present: Vasili, George, Daria, Rafaella
## What has been done from last meeting:
Vasili made an extra post on twitter and facebook introducing our web application and its purpose, however he reported there was problem with the instagram account that it got suspended for some reason and we decided to put it on the side for now and deal with it another time.
George created the functionality of the user inserting their username before starting the quiz and also retrieving the questions and answering them with a basic input field.
Daria implimented the leaderboard page functionality. 
Mr. Nicos Kasenides helped us with how we should ask the user for their location by implimenting the askForLocation and showPositon functions and he left the rest of the functionality to be continued by us. He also helped us clear the input field of the answer every time we move to a new question.
## Tasks set until next meeting:
Rafella will design the start.html and question.html
Daria will manage the input field of answering the question depending on data type required and will change the leaderboard for the user to access it only if they are answering questions or at the scoreboard
Vasili will impliment showing the score when the quiz ends.
George will impliment the skip question and geolocation for getting the location of the user when the question asks for it. Also try to use cookies for the session of the treasure hunt instead of using it from the url.
